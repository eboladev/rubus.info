# Rubus #

(Please note that this page is far from done, and I'll add more information as it comes.)

Rubus is an attempt at creating easily acquired (and used, of course) cluster computers based around the [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org).

Each _Rubus_ cluster will contain one _Drupelet_ which controls multiple _Bramble Boxes_.
The _Drupelet_ is the cluster controller, and provides a web-based interface to the _Bramble Boxes_ using a mere 2.5W of power.
A _Bramble Box_ is a box containing individual nodes (in a _Rubus_ cluster the nodes are all _Raspberry Pi_s). Expected cost per _Drupelet_ is $100<sup><a href="#footer1">[1]</a></sup>.

Estimated specifications for one _Bramble Box_ are as follows:

A single _Bramble Box_ will theoretically be able to provide approximately 7 <abbr title="gigahertz">GHz</abbr> of processing power and 2.5 <abbr title="gigabytes">GB</abbr> of <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>. The GPUs should be capable of approximately 240 <abbr title="billion floating-point operations per second">GFLOPS</abbr>. It will use 22.5 Watts of power total. Expected cost per _Bramble Box_ is $500 or less<sup><a href="#footer1">[1]</a></sup>.
